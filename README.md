# Indigo Coal Color Theme

A dark theme that's easy on the eyes and highlights the most important bits. 

Program structures like `let` and `function` are pushed to the background and variables, types, declarations are all pulled forward for your eyes to feast on. 
(Just don't consume too much at one time)
